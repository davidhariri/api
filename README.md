## Media
Media can be images or GIFs and upload to static.dhariri.com. This is essentially an upload endpoint with some optimization features. For example, GIFs are uploaded on their own, but return with an MP4 link and a poster image. Static images return with an optimized version as well. See fields below.

#### URL Naming
`url_optimized` contains some helpful information about the media embedded in the file name for aiding graceful loading of the media itself:

`<ASPECT_RATIO>_<AVG_COLOR_HEX>_<UUID><?.thumb|?.poster>.<jpeg|mp4>`

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | An auto-incremented id for the media |
| `date_created` | The date and time at which the media was created |
| `date_updated` | The date and time at which the media was last updated |
| `uuid` | A unique id string used to identify the media |
| `media_type` | The type of media that was uploaded |
| `url` | The URL of the raw file that was uploaded. This could be called the "full size" or "large" media. |
| `url_optimized` | The URL of the optimized version of the file that was uploaded. This is what will be used most often. |
| `url_poster` | If the file uploaded is a GIF, this is a picture of the first frame of the optimized version. |
| `showcase` | A boolean for whether or not this media should be showcased. Useful for a photograph that's more of a "work of art". |
| `width` | The width of the original file |
| `height` | The height of the original file |
| `aspect` | The aspect ratio of the original file. This is embedded in the file name. |
| `shot_exposure` | The exposure of the image. Pulled from EXIF tags. |
